# An Intro to Database Sharding

The `controller.py` file in this repository takes the file named `chapter2.txt` and emulates a simple horizontally sharded database, allowing easy understanding of how data is distributed across nodes. This particular handler is unfinished; it can initialize nodes and add nodes to an initialized list, but it cannot remove nodes or handle replication. That is an exercise for the reader.

Content in `chapter2.txt` retrieved from https://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/452/page_number/1/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone#excerpt.
